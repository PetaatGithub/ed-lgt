Exact Diagonalization for Lattice Gauge Theories!
============================================================================

The Exact Diagonalization Library for Lattice Gauge Theories provides a powerful set of tools 
for performing exact diagonalization calculations on 2-dimensional lattices, 
specifically targeting both Abelian and non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theories. 
This library empowers researchers and practitioners in the field of quantum many-body 
systems to analyze and explore the behavior of complex lattice gauge theories through 
the precise computation of Hamiltonian eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
